# Thor Environment

Dec. 9th:

Make sure you install skimage for image rescaling



V1:
Install by the instructions on http://vuchallenge.org/thor.html.
After the installation you should have two folders in this path:

- thor-201705011400-Linux64_Data
- thor-challenge-targets

Then running thor.py should work.
